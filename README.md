# An example of building a docker image


Build a docker image with overflow that uses the new onflow/crypto 0.25.0 that requires CGO


This uses goreleaser to build the app and the ko plugin to build the image with ko. 

Github actions will trigger on a tag pushed and build a new image an publis it. 


## Error with ko

When using ko in goreleaser with an image built with CGO_ENABLED=1 (in main branch) i do not get a working image.

```
docker-compose up

```

However if i build it using CGO_ENABLED=0 it works in the branch (with-old-crypto)
